# Ati's C-like Compiler

This is the playground for me to see what I need from a low-level language.

Created due to my interest in language development, and because I felt like C was outdated/lacking in features useful in development.

Main changes include (but not limited to):

* No headers
* Everything is 1 compilation unit
* Length-prefixed strings
* Builtin array type
